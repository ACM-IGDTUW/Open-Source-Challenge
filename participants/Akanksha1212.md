# Hello World!

I am Akanksha. I love coding, quizzing and reading books. You can find my quiz questions here  [Curious Curie](https://curiouscuriequiz.wordpress.com/)

## Some fun facts

*  The word robot comes from the Czech word “robota” which translates to forced labor or work. It was first used to refer to a fictional humanoid in a play in 1920
* Spam mail was named after the canned meat! In a _Monty Python_ skit, they said Spam meat was “horrible and being ubiquitous and inescapable”.
* The first mechanical alarm clock could only ring at 4 a.m. invented by Levi Hutchins in 1787. It wasn’t until 1876 that a wind-up alarm clock was made that could be set for any time.
* In 2004, the @ symbol became the first new character to be added to Morse code for the first time in many decades. The character is called a “Commat,” and consists of the signals for A and C with no break in between.
