# About Myself:
  I'm a second year student at SNDTWU, Mumbai pursuing B.Tech in Electronics engineering. Communities have a special place in my heart! I co-organize and attend community events, network with like-minded people, have even delivered few talks and consume knowledge to learn new things.
studying electronics and being a programmer has taught me to be multitasking, as knowing a bit of hardware and a bit of software is extremely useful.
I am always looking for opportunities allowing me to learn gripping technologies to boost my passion for programming.
